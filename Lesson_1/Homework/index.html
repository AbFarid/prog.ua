						<h2>Rickrolling</h2>
						<p>
							Rickrolling, alternatively rick-rolling, is a prank and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme">Internet meme</a> involving an unexpected appearance of the music video for the 1987 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley">Rick Astley</a> song "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up">Never Gonna Give You Up</a>".
							The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink.
							Those led to the music video believing that they were accessing some unrelated material are said to have been <i>rickrolled</i>.<sup><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rickroll">[1]</a></sup>
							The trend has extended to disruptive or humorous appearances of the song in other situations, such as a live appearance of Astley himself in the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York.<sup><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3534073/Macys-Thanksgiving-Day-parade-Rick-Astley-performs-his-own-Rickroll.html">[2]</a></sup>

						<h3>Effects on Astley and reaction</h3>
						<p>
							In a March 2008 interview, Astley said that he found the rickrolling of Scientology to be "hilarious"; he also said that he will not try to capitalise on the rickroll phenomenon with a new recording or remix of his own, but that he would be happy to have other artists remix it.
							Overall, Astley is not troubled by the phenomenon, stating that he finds it "bizarre and funny" and that his only concern is that his "daughter doesn't get embarrassed about it."
							 A spokesperson for Astley's record label released a comment which showed that Astley's interest with the phenomenon had faded, as they stated, "I'm sorry, but he's done talking about Rickrolling".
