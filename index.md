## About

This repository contains the result pages for class- and homework tasks of the **prog.ua** web dev course. For the most part, the pages are trash, except a few neat ones. Content is mostly in Russian. Keeping these for no reason other than sentimental *value*.

Links marked with a ★ are the ones more or less worth checking out.
